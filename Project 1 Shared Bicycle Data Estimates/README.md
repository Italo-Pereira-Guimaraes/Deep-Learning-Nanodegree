# Shared Bicycle Data Estimates

## Introduction

In this project, you will make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! By building a neural network from scratch, you will understand much better how the gradient, backpropagation, and other important concepts work before we start using tools like Tensorflow. You also get a chance to see your network solving a real problem!

The data come from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). 

## Software dependencies

Make sure the `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `jupyter notebook` are installed:

`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`
