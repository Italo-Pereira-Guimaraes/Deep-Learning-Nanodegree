# Generating Faces with GANs

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to generate face images using opposing generator networks, DCGAN has been trained in the CelebA dataset, with images of real people to generate images of new, realistic human faces.

This project is part of Udacity's deep learning nanodegree program, if you are interested in checking out the original project, see the `face_generation` folder in this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git).

## Software Dependencies
